# Interfacing with Arduino Mini

The mini does not contain a USB port. We need an FTDI for programming it (or flashing your program on it). I am using an [FTDI232 USB to UART IC](https://robu.in/product/ft232rl-usb-to-ttl-5v-3-3v-download-cable-to-serial-adapter-module-for-arduino/) that I bought on robu.in
